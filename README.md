The objective of this game is to move the frog through a path of static and moving obstacles, reaching the end of
the levels without dying with the highest score possible. 

The character is a frog that must cross a series of busy roads, rivers, train tracks and lava. He has 3 lives and every time he loses one, his position is reseted.

This game is based on a mix of two well-known games: Crossy Road and Frogger.
